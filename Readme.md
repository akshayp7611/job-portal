## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-portal.git
   cd job-portal
   

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

      Open two separate terminals and navigate to the respective directories:

      **Terminal 1: Frontend**
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      npm run dev
      ```

      **Terminal 2: Backend**
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm install
      npm start
      ```

3. Access the application:

         Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

         ```
